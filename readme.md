The **Migrations** plugin enables developers to quickly and easily manage and migrate between database schema versions.

As an application is developed, changes to the database may be required, and managing that in teams can get extremely difficult. The **Migrations** plugin enables you to share and coordinate database changes in an iterative manner, removing the complexity of handling these changes.

* **Console:** The console script allows you to run migrations up and down.
* **Installation:** Migrations can also be run programmatically via an installer script.
* **ORM:** The **Migrations** plugin makes use of the *CakePHP* ORM and supports all databases provided by the framework.

This is NOT a Backup Tool
-------------------------

We highly recommend to not run the **Migrations** plugin in a production environment directly *without* doing a backup first.

However, you can make use of the ```before()``` and ```after()``` callbacks in the migration files to add logic which triggers a backup script.

Requirements
------------

* CakePHP 2.4+
* PHP 5.2.8+
